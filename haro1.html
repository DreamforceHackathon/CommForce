Category: Business and Finance 

Email: query-4a56@helpareporter.net 

Media Outlet: http://acbj.com/

Deadline: 7:00 PM EST - 9 October 

Query: 

I am a writer working on a story for the American City Business
Journals national special sections desk. It is a piece about how
social media use by employees can affect business security
(especially for small businesses).

The questions are: 

Do employees put their companies at risk through social media?
If they say too much in personal social media postings, could
they put proprietary business info at risk? For example, are
they posting photos -- such as from an office birthday
celebration -- that show the location, nature and security
features of key physical assets, computer servers, etc.? Or are
they over sharing about projects they are working on? How might
criminals or competitors use this information?

I am looking at this from the perspective of both physical
security and data security. How significant is this risk, and
what can businesses do to mitigate it? 
Requirements: 

I'd like to include comments and tips from business security
experts. I'd like to talk to consultants, academics and other
independent professionals as opposed to companies selling
security products. 

If there are many replies, I may not answer right away unless I
plan to use the pitch.

Name: Rick Asa Chicago Tribune

Category: General 

Email: query-4a36@helpareporter.net 

Media Outlet: Chicago Tribune

Deadline: 11:00 PM CST - 15 October 

Query: 

The context is for busy families and the holidays. The story
would run before Thanksgiving. How do parents create lasting
memories for their kids? In other words, what experiences/events
are they most likely to remember and carry with them into
adulthood? The parties? The quieter family time? The epochal
visit to Santa? The rituals (making cookies every year with
Grandma)? Getting $2,000 worth of gifts on Christmas morning?
Is there an easier way for parents to create enduring holiday
memories without scrambling all over hell and high water - in
other words, is decorating the artificial tree you buy at Target
just as good as spending a day chopping one down yourself?
Requirements: 

I want to talk to experts/researchers to get the latest info on
this. Could be scientists, psychologists, family therapists with
knowledge of new research, or have done new research. The answer
may be to simplify, or may be more proactive? Or simply being
willing to embrace awkward silence, introspection, contemplation
in the moment? Don't want to drive anyone away who might think
they don't exactly fit this query. If you think you have
something to contribute, please do. Great photos, of course, can
be instant reminders that trigger a flood of memories, but this
isn't about photographs, per se. It's more so what keeps
something vivid in the mind over time. A little nuanced, I
realize.

I am writing a service piece aimed at part-timers/freelancers on

created continues to lag behind full-time employment. A full
third of workers are now freelancers, according to a new report
from Freelancers Union. Getting hired full-time may increasingly
be turning into a two-step process: Get on board first as a
part-time or contract worker, and then try to convert to a
full-time job. This story would show how people can successfully
parlay a part-time gig into a full-time career.

Are there any industries you feel fit the bill better than most?

Any other relevant advice or experiences welcome. Thanks so much!
